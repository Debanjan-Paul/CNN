Doesn't work. Will be sending back---home. Tried pairing it up over 10 times with Iphone, which is with Verizon, and it didnot work with phone. Expecting a refund back when I get the CD back to send with the rest of items. Thank you anyway.
Works well, good audio quality, battery lasts a long time.
I already had 3 BT headsets and saw the Plantronics in an airport. Couldn't justify spending money on another one. Got home and had another complaint about the sound quality of a call with a business associate and caved as Amazon had it for a really good price. I paired the Voyager and was immediately impressed by the instant improvement in the quality of the calls. Sound is clear, range is good and it is so comfortable. This is unquestionably the best BT headset I have ever used. I give it 2 thumbs up!!!
There have been innumerable reviews about this item, so I'll keep mine short.  This is fantastic.  I had the first generation Jawbone, an expensive and well reviewed item, but I prefer this hands down.The volume on the earpiece is much louder.People hear me much better.This is waaay more comfortable on my ear.So far its much more sturdy than the wire earpiece on my Jawbone I (which broke constantly)Downside:  it does look a bit dorky and lacks the style of the Jawbone, but it is so much more comfortable.  Kind of like that favorite thing you like to wear.I can't speak to the new versions of the Jawbone, but this is a great deal.
I have owned two bluetooth headsets (Which I might add were expensive and pieces of crap), My past bluetooth headsets produced noise and a lot of echo to where the people I was talking to said they can hear themselves talking in the background. I would have to say I almost gave up on trying another bluetooth, until I came across this one, I saw how many people purchased this one and how much positive feedback I read about this product and I had to try it out. As soon as I got it, I was able to Pair it with my phone within' 30 seconds or less and I was able to hear people very clear as they were able to hear me just as well. Finally a real bluetooth that is worth the money.  You have to get this bluetooth if you're looking for one, you won't be sorry.
I bought this headset based on the reviews of other individuals who indicated that they were hard of hearing and this device worked well.  As someone who is very hard of hearing (80-90% in both ears), it really did not work well.  The ear insert did not go far enough in to give me a comfortable fit or a fit that would provide good sound quality.  It also was not loud or clear enough.  My husband took it and is using it, and as a non-hearing impaired person, he likes the headset a lot and thinks the sound quality is great.  I ended up buying the Jabra 250VT model and it works much better for me.  The volume is much louder and I can hear on it.  The fit of the ear bud is also much better and is similar to a hearing aid.
Loved the sound quality of this, but didn't stay put securly (especially while on a bike).  Maybe the earpiece just didn't fit me, but tried other sizes & still had the same problem.
I loved it even though two weeks after purchasing it the LED dies. Well who wants to have a flashing blue light on one's head anyway?Sound quality was great on both ends though I was somewhat dubious about the noise cancelling microphone as with people complained about wind noise when I was in the car and the fan was on minimum blowing air past it. Maybe it was related to the broken LED? I'd be interested to hear other peoples experience.What killed it finally was that I must have over rotated the microphone boom as the side button no longer works which makes it impossible to pickup calls.Needs a USB power connector which they now appear to have on the newer more expensive models which also come with poorer reviews.
I purchased this unit, a little leery about BT technology. Well after almost a year of testing, it fits comfortably, I have inadvertenly walked (while pulling weeds) up to 70 feet away (range listed at 33 feet) from my phone before getting disconnected, and it has also held its charge. I have been so pleased with it, I purchased for my mom and one for my girlfriend.
I am very disappointed in this product.  The sound is not very clear.  It falls off my ear frequently.  I think this might be better for a very large man, but it definitely is uncomfortable and unwieldy for me.  It falls off as I am driving, which creates the hazard it is meant to prevent.  And it is a pain to keep asking people to repeat themselves because the sound quality is so iffy.
i went out on a limb with this one since there were no PS3 reviews for it that I could find and I must say I had absolutley no problems connected great EZ to use sound quality is perfectAnd battery life is longer than what the box Projects Ive used the headset for 4+ hours and the box only gives it a 3 hour life
As the title of my review says, this is the best bluetooth headset I've ever owned.  I have tried numerous headsets to see if they match a wired one in sound quality, including numerous Motorola and previous Plantronics sets.  This is the first headset that gives acceptable sound quality both sending and receiving on my Treo 700P.  I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a bluetooth headset, no matter what the price.
This headset has great sound quality, I can hear everything that is being said.  And just as important, the other person can hear me without an echo.  I have tried one other bluetooth headset, but everyone complained about the echo...so this took care of everything.
Great headset - I've had it for a few months now, and I have to say it has exceeded expectations.  The sound is crystal clear, it's easy to turn on/off, and the battery life is reasonably long.  My only wish is that I could use it while it's re-charging, but that is a small enough sacrifice.  All around, I think this is a great product at an affordable price.
My wife and I purchased a couple different Motorola headsets prior to finally trying the Voyager 510.  Allot of background noise was present with the Motorolas, i.e. road noise while driving was the biggest annoyance.  The Voyager 510 models are much quieter with almost no background noise issues whatsoever.  It is comfortable to wear; however a little more cumbersome to slip over the ear than others we have tried.  The Voyager 510 is easy to configure with your phone and once configured, never looses synch even after multiple power on/off cycles, unlike the Motorolas we tried.  It's a great little device to add simplicity to using your cell phone!
Not complaining about the seller at all, because there is nothing to complain about. The headset, on the other hand, is mediocre. That is because even when you are standing next to the phone there is still some static. the range of clear call is about a medium sized room. I suppose that there is a way to hang up a call and use voice dialing through the headset, but couldn't figure it out yet.
Excellent bluetooth headset. Reception is excellent and transmission is equally good. A little bulky but I am willing to live with that for the quality of the sound. Good battery life. The charging plug does fall out easily so you have to make sure that it is plugged in and charging when you leave it for the evening.
I got this headset because of high praises and recommendation of a good friend of mine.  But unfortunately, like all of the other bluetooth headsets that I've pair w/ my Treo 650, the headset performance was sporadic - most of the time people complain they can't hear me very well, every once in a while no problem.  If you have a Treo 650, then this might not be for you.
It seems like a good product other then the short distance away from the phone untill it starts fading signal. Cheaper models of blue tooth devises I found have better range then that. Otherwise it seems to be a good product, i suppose
If this is the best bluetooth has to offer, then the technology has a long way to go. I have been forced to stop using the device since no one can understand a word I am saying. I am forced to look for a different headset, hopefully one that actually does what it is designed for.
I love this! The ear piece rotates easily and is flexible so it won't breat. The sound quality is great too. I'm very pleased with this.
I've had this Headset for about a year and its impressed me in that I haven't lost it. The connection is clear and the signal is strong. The only thing about it that I lost one of the ear buds to it and now I have another one which is a bit uncomfortable, at least initially, but then you get used it. I would recommend this set because it's not too small and not too big.
After reviewing all the bluetooth headsets available I am most satisfied with this purchase, first the savings was fantastic, 46 dollars versus 99 from my cell company. Also it is very comfortable on the ear and very easy to pair to the phone. I also like the fact it is rechargeable. The reception and clarity is unparalelled. I wouldnt buy any other headset and highly recommend this one.
This unit is very comfortable and it has good clarity for the audio in the earpiece.  I was pleasantly surprised how well I could hear while driving as other models did not work as well.  I would recommend this item.
This is a convenient, compact, clear, comfortable and easy to use headset.The quality of the audio is excellent.  It's far better than that of my cell phone.It easily connects to cell phones.  Lets you know when the battery is low and quickly re-charges.  A single charge lasts for a sufficient amount of time. Note: you can't talk using the headset while it is recharging. Although you can still hear the person on the other end of the line clearly, whoever you are talking to can't hear you well.The range is about 30 feet, farther than that it starts to break up (It would be nice if the range was farther).
I've used a number of headsets, but this one seems to be the best.  I am able to hear others and they can hear me, so other than the bulky size there's not much more I could ask for.  It is also surprisingly comfortable.  Ultimately I will probably also get a headset w/ noise cancellation as I travel a lot and callers have commented that they could hear significant background noise in airports and train stations, but otherwise this works very well.
I used this headset for more than a year only recently did I start noticing audio problems for both incoming and outgoing audio. Until this came up it was very good. You can read more on the web about others having a similar experiencing. There is even some on the Plantronics forum ([...]).
Finally got my first bluetooth headset, settled on this after to numerous great reviews.  No complaints, works well, hearing is fine, compacts and is easy to store and travel with.  I'd recommend it to others!
The Plantronics device works well with my Treo 700wx and my company issued Blackberry 8830. Callers tell me I sound very clear and the caller can hear you in noisy environments. Great Product!!
It works fine when people call me, but when I call people it doesn't work 50% of the time.  I use it for work, and when I have to call a client back because my headset doesn't work, that does not look good.  I wish I could send it back because it was $75 of wasted money.
I bought this product for my son who is a musician. He is thrilled with it and the performance of the headset. He finds it gives great reception wherever he uses it. I chose it on the basis of previous reviews and they turned out to be accurate. V. pleased all round.
Before I bought this headset, I tried a Motorola, a Jabra and a Logitech.  None of them even came close to the clarity and volume this headset produces.  I have an LG VX8300 cell phone and I can hear people better with the headset than without.  You have to experience this headset to truly appreciate the quality.  Get this one.  You won't be sorry.
No complaints from this headset.  It's comfortable in the ear, has a mute function and works flawlessly with my PS3 and KRAZR!
I bought this product on [...] a couple of months ago. When the mouth piece fell off unexpectedly I went onto the Plantronics website to see what I could do. I filled out a form and got a new device days later. I just had to send my original device back to them.SUPER EASY. I really recommend Plantronics.
I was excited to get this device but after using it for a few minutes I heard a lot of crackling static noise. The device boasts reduced wind noise but the person I was calling stated they could barely hear me because of the wind.The battery life is OK but not as described either.The earpiece is bulky and the device is bulky.
This is an excellent headset. Sync very good with your bluetooth device and fits very good on your ear.
This product is easy to pair, easy to use, and, for the most part, has great sound quality.  It's one flaw, and it is probably not uncommon to bluetooth headsets in general, is that you can hear the wind.  For example, when using in the car, you can hear the air conditioning blowing in the background.
For it's size, it fits nicely around the ear and works very well, no sound loss anywhere. A good buy!!!
This was a gift for my aunt.  In 3 minutes we paired it with her LG Voyager.  I called her while she was wearing the headset, and the sound quality was excellent on both ends.  It fit perfectly in her ear.  3 differently sized, detachable ear buds are included for different sized ears.  She loves it.  Overall a great product.
bought this recently after reading all the positive reports. though plantronics is well known for having some of the best BT headsets and this one seems to be in that category, i was disappointed by the amount of noise that comes through the earplug, plus others on the line had a tough time reading me clearly
The listen side is very good and varies with the earbud you choose (from those provided).  The talk side works very well unless their is consistent breeziness or wind.  When there is wind or breeze the other party often can't understand, so I guess, as good as Plantronic's noise cancelling technology is, perhaps nothing works perfectly.  But overall I really like this headset and would recommend it highly.
I am truly impressed by the Plantronics Voyager 510 Bluetooth Headset.  It quickly sinc'ed up with my Motorola cell phone and the ease of use is very appealing.  The price is not so shabby either; this item was $99.00 but Amazon had it on sale for less than $45.00. It also works well with voice recognition on my cell so it is hands free while I'm driving.This was well worth the money.
This is a great product! Settled on this after trying couple of Motorola products....I am glad I got this, and it does exactly as it promises. Along with its exceptional voice quality and its range, I especially like its ability to connect to two devices at the same time. This is very convenient for me since I carry two phones, one personal and the other given by my company, and no matter which of those I use, the headset is active. I have not found any other Bluetooth headset that supports two devices simultaneously!!!Definitely worth a buy!!!
So far so good.  My wife says it looks bulky on hand but once on your ear not so.  Good sound quality, can barely tell you are on a Bluetooth.
It works well- reception is clear, however - it is a little awkward to fit behind the ear and it feels like it is going to fall out a lot.  I tried the various ear inserts and none of them feel very good.
This is the second Bluetooth that I have used and I have purchased 2 units over the last couple of years.  I am very happy with the listening and voice quality and the 510 is very well built.  Wearing for a couple of hours in the car is not a problem.  However, I do not like the size of the volume and power buttons and had to order a car charger separately, which was tough to find.
I have tried many bluetooth headsets and this one tops them all!  It is priced competitively, battery life is good, sound quality is great and unlike previous Motorola bluetooth headsets, this one fits in your ear snugly and stays there!
This is a solid performer, and comfortable to wear, use.  It take a couple of seconds to connect from the phone to the headset, so sometimes you'll lose the "Hello" or so... otherwise no problems, charge holds well.  Worth the $45.
I have to agree with the majority of previous reviewers, the headset is very good. Good audio quality on both ends and comfortable to wear ALMOST all day long!
I have a Sanyo 8200 cell phone using this headset with the Jabra BT adapter.However, like the other reviewer using the Jabra Bluetooth adapter, I had major problems with the transmitted voice.  The adapter and headset connected fine and lasted a long time battery-wise, and on my end, the sound quality was excellent.BUT, the transmitted voice quality was very poor.  My friends reported that they were only getting portions of the conversation with a lot of background noise and echoes.  Therefore, this headset is useless.I am very disappointed.
I'm not a phone techy by any means. I've owned this headset for several months now and have been very satisfied with it. It is very comfortable to wear and works well with my LGenV. There are minor drawbacks mainly the challenge of working the buttons above your ear while driving, but once the volume is set, all I really need to do is click on and off the call button.It's light to wear, works well with my phone and is reliable.
I'll keep this short and sweet.This is my FIRST bluetooth device. It just so happened that I got one of the best ones out there. I even like the distance I can be from the phone and still talk, with NO PROBLEM!Buy this one.
Overall, the voyager 510 is a very good headset.It's light weight, sound good, good mic, not sure about the range if it's my Razr V3c or the Plantronics who's kind of limited on distance to keep the sound clear (some feet away and static noise appears) But in the car it's OK.The only con I would have is, the power button, It is so small and bad ingeneered that makes it very difficult to operate, you don't even know if you actualy push on it to turn it on!! You have to look at the LED if it's getting online or not!!
I purchased this for my husband and I can hear him better on it than the corded earpiece he was using.  Highly recommend this product.  My husband thinks that it is very comfortable but wishes he could listen to music on his Smartphone with it instead of having to switch to the corded earpiece.He was proud of me for researching this product and picking the very one he wanted.
Yesterday the earpiece went through the washing machine.  I had no hope for it, but the red light went on when I plugged it in.  I couldn't get the blue light to come on until I tried hours later.  Shazzam!  It works!  I find this absolutely unbelievable.  Too bad I had already ordered a Voyager 925 as a replacement, though I got it at a great price ($49.99).What's next?  Woolite for Electronics?
Headset has quite bad microphone; people complain much more than with my old Motorola Headset about the voice quality and amount of noise. Not worth the price.
This thing worked fine for about a week! Now I have to constantly re-connect it to the phone and battery life is very short!!  Spend a little more and get your moneys worth.
I bought this not knowing if it would work with my phone.  It does work with the Motorola L2.  It was easy to connect.  It's light, and not as difficult to reach the buttons as some say.  Altogether a great purchase.
Great headset, sounds good and has a long battery life. Small and comfortable to wear.
GOT THIS BLUETOOTH 4 MONTHS AGO AND IS THE BEST YET.IT FITS SO WELL I FOTGET I`M USING IT UNTILL IT RINGS.
It sits in my ears really well.  The buttons are on the back so I'm not pushing into my ear in order to change the volume, etc.
I have purchased other Bluetooth devices, that I was not impressed with. However, the Plantronics Voyager 510 is easy to recommend.  I can hear better with the headset, than I can just talking on my phone without it.  The clarity is great, it is easy to use, easy to pair and fits comfortably on my ear.  It does not feel like it is going to fall off, even when I am walking around with it on.  It is perfect for driving and great when I want to do things requiring both hands around the house.  I have not had any complaints from the people I talk to while using it either.  I love it and for a mid-range priced Bluetooth headset, IT CAN'T BE BEAT!
I generally use my 510 in the car with the windows open.I hear others as if they are right next to me.I'm told I sound the same as if I was on a cell phone but with better wind canceling.The battery life is exceptional.It's very comfortable on either ear as long as you choose the right earpiece for you (included in the package).The only negative to me is that the power button is a bit of a pain to turn off.  It's very small, awkwardly placed and requires some oomph to shut down.  That is a very small complaint for an otherwise amazing headset.
The product might be great years ago, but not great anymore if compare with the latest BT headset.First, the ear hook is a little bit big to me so it's easy to fall off. Second, the shinning blue light is a bit annoyed in the night and this phone doesn't have noise canceling.The worst, when I got this product, it seemed like a refurbished one to me cause there are scratches on the body... just didn't feel good.
This works very good I am happy with this Item. I tried those MotorolaH500, H700, and few more, This is the best one I liked. I am using this with my RAZER V3. The ear piece sit perfectly in the ear and the rest fit exactly behind the ear. No problem switching between Left or Right ear.
Good device.  What you need to do to connect with your phone is to go to the Platronics website. Follow instructions for your particular phone and provider.It takes few minutes.
I previously had another brand's bluetooth headset and was very unhappy. I researched this one because it had the highest rating on Amazon and it has turned out to be an excellent product.The battery life is outstanding. The sound quality is as good as a wired headset and the range is very impressive. Highly recommended!!
Pros: This headset surprised me by how clear the voice quality is.  The calls are actually easier to hear through this than through my own phone now.  The volume can be adjusted easily and I've actually had to do that since, on the loudest setting, it's almost too loud.Cons: The physical size of this is pretty big when compared to other bluetooth headsets available.  Because of this, it's a little uncomfortable for me to wear after awhile.  Also the power button is tiny which makes it hard to turn on and off quickly and easily.
I bought a year ago a Motorola HS820 Bluetooth headset, and the problems described by everybody in the reviews are real, that headset simply didn't work as expected. I decided later that this Plantronics headset was worth a try, and simply are great. Maybe, a minor downside in this product is the battery life (4 days in idle so far, I haven't tested in a large conversation yet), but the quelity of sound is superb
I had Jabra before I got this headset. The connection would constantly get dropped and the other end says it's very noisy. I use the headset for work and was told by my client that I needed a new headset. I got this one and all problems were resolved. I now only need one headset for use on both Skype on my computer and my cell phone.Like others said, the only drawback is the power button but it doesn't bother me much and I am still giving it five stars.
This is an excellent bluetooth headset.  Sound is always good, no problems with wind noise.  The people that I am talking to never complain about not being able to hear me.  The ear buds in different sizes allow for a perfect fit.  It is a little large, but once it is on your ear, it is very comfortable, I forget I have it on.  Controls are small, but now that I am used to them, not a problem. I would highly recommend this product.
This is the 4th 510 bluetooth I have owned all have worked great. I drive a truck and I have had no problem hearing or the other people hearing me. This certian one I have trouble hearing people, don't know what it is. I have ordered at least 10 for other drivers and they have had no problem.
I've tried other cheaper brands before, but were all horrible, until I got the Voyager 510. It works great with my LG VX8600 with little or no static. It has a very long battery life and after two weeks I'm very satisfied with my purchase. One minor issue is that it sometimes it stops responding to my phone and I'd have to turn off my phone to get it up and working, but this has happened rarely. I highly recommend this bluetooth even over the more expensive ones.
Probably because I am easily confused by a few buttons, this was difficult to learn to use.  I still am not sure what all the beeps are that I hear.  But I do have small ears and other hands free devices don't feel comfortable or stay on and this one does.  It does take time to get used to, and don't try to shove it in your ear canal, but it works great.
it is a good quality of headset, but it is not comparable with ipod touch 2nd G, OS 3.0.
This is truly one of the best bluetooth sets I have ever seen or used. For the price its great. The thing behind the ear looks really big, but its actually really comfortable. Great buy for the price.
have been very satisfied with the performance of this bluetooth. The sound quality is great and the fit is perfect.
When I got this headset the first thing I did was attach the ear piece and try it on. At first it seemed like it might be a little big for my ear... I thought it was gonna fall off my ear when I was wearing it but later realized that its only because of the piece that goes behind your ear. So far I have not had any problems with it, and it actually stays on quite well. It's so light weight that I hardly notice it anymore.
We have tried everything from the moto-850 to the other plantronics and after seeing this in a gold box deal thought what the heck.  To my amazement it has been really a fantastic headset. Easy to pair, easy to adjust volume, great battery life, very clear even with wind noise and city sounds around, and last but not least it has an indicator light that does not look like an emergency strobe (I hated my mot-850 for that at night it would reflect off the glass and the dash in the car or the side window and drive you insane...)All and all a 5 star unit
I ordered the headset for my motorola mobile and it works exceptionally well. The voice is very clear and volume is great and people didn't realise i was using the headset because it was so clear..... it fits just right on the ear. The supplier (SF Planet) sent the item on the day of order and for that I give them a 5+...... Good Price for great performance.
I still use this. Works great. Holds a charge for a few days. Great clarity and pairs well with my mobile phones.
I've tried other headsets, but I keep returning to this one.  It's well balanced on the ear and comfortable that I frequently forget that I'm wearing it.  The noise cancelling isn't as effective with a lot of wind noise.
I have been a user of blue tooth earpieces for the past three years when they first came out.  I have tried many, including other models of Plantronics as well as Jabra, Sony and Motorolla.  None is better than this one.  Has the best call clarity, best distance from the device and longest battery and hence the size.Believe me, buy on this one.  Don't waste time and money on any other models of Plantronics and don't even attempt other brands.
I bought this mainly for use on my PS3, and it works perfectly.  It's comfortable, easy to set up, and the quality is very good.
I own this and have for about 7 months. I loved it. Then the volume control popped off. I called Planatronics and they promptly replaced the unit. Sent it to my home at their cost. I can once again talk hands free.
I have a Samsung D807.It's a piece of cake to set up.  It's very comfortable.  I think it looks cooler than those other ones that look humongous in your ear.  So far, no one is able to tell when I'm using it or when I'm talking into the phone.My wife and I have the same phone/headsets, and we've used them together without any interference.
Bought this product for my Dad after reading all the reviews. It is very comfortable, easy to use and the sound quality is great.The only thing I didn't like was the on/off button seems hard to push and it is very small.
I love my headset.  It is clear and comfortable.  I could wear it all day.
This is my second bluetooth headset.  The first I bought when I got my phone, the LG NV from Verizon.  I could hear well on that headset, but everyone who talked to me complained they could hear themselves echo, so I stopped using it.  After reviewing different headsets on Amazon, I chose this one.  I'm very happy with it!  I have no problems understanding anyone, and the person on the other end says they hear me well, with no echo.  It's been a great headset and I'm really glad I got it.
As this is my first bluetooth, i'm no expert on them.  i've been very happy with this one, it operates flawlessly with my krzr phone.
Great sound quality in the car. People hear me OK even with the music in the car (not blasting), and when the windows are slightly open.It's a little larger the i expected but comfortable even over glasses. (yes don't forget that your glasses will interfere with most over-the-ear setups.Power button is hard to press, because it doesn't go in, it kinda shifts to the side and you do not get a nice click response(audio or otherwise).
I bought the 510 based on the volume of positive reviews.  Well if this truly is the best bluetooth headset then I'm going back to using a wired headset.  Sound quality was poor, people couldn't hear me if there was any background noise and the ear pieces were all uncomfortable.
I bought this model for my wife after her last one died. It was her third or fourth..? I've lost track. This model does not compare to the others; it's much better. It hooked up easy to her Verizon phone and sounds clear on BOTH ends. I hear her fine and her voice is crisp and clear. What else is there? Oh yes, price.... around $40...Buy one, you will not be sorry.
I bought this product after reading the reviews on Amazon.com.  I had a similar product and absolutely loved it. This product is good, however the talking period is very short.  I was hoping to get at least 6-hour talking time before a charge was necessary.  Not the case.  The most I can expect is 4 hours.  Overall, product is great but could use more talk time.
I fell in love with this headset instantly.  It provided a snug fit for my small ears and delivered great sound and quality signal. Now unfortuantly I will be forced to buy a new headset because the headset is falling apart.  The swivel earbud is detatching from the ear portal.  It still works but the last thing i need is for my bluetooth to end up in two pieces.
I had one of these for about a year after my Jabra headset died. On the whole it did the job well, pairing was quick and easy and voice performance was good. With my phone a double tap on the mic button would redial the last number but I only got voice dialing to work once. The earhook  design sits better on my head so I could use it for several hours although sunglasses can be inconvenient.I would have given it 4 stars but mine lost its power switch recently so I need a new bluetooth headset, I might even buy another one of these.
It worked out of the package.  It has several size earbuds so that you get the right size for you.  It paired with my phone easily, and it is comfortable to wear: not too heavy and it doesn't feel like it's going to fall off any second.  Great product!
I use a Motorola E815 phone which is very similar to the V710. I have tried at least 5 different bluetooth headsets with varying but poor results. Static and echo being the two biggest problems. This headset solved it all. I only wish I had tried this one first. The reviews here on Amazon are what convinced me to purchase. The value of reviewing products is very obvious. Thanks everyone, and I highly recommend this headset.
I've had it now for over a month and even had the opportunity during a crisis t o use the complete 5 or 6 hrs hours talk time in one day.No one has complained about not being able to hear me clearly and the fact that it stands up to windy conditions is a real bonus.I would have prefered a USB recharging option - thats the one lacking feature but I've had plenty of plantronics ear pieces before so have plenty of chargers to go around from home and office.Highly recommend it !
